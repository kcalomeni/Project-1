#TreasureHunt

My intentions for this project I created last semester were to develop a game that requires different outcomes. The game is supposed to be challenging, and
it took me awhile before finally finishing and creating a successful project. I had a lot of fun with this code, and I was really impressed with myself and how
hard work really does pay off! Take a look, I hope you like it as much as I did creating it!
